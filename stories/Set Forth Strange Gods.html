  const PAYLOAD = `Hey Jeannie. Did you know the internet was created as a panopticon?
Who are you? 
\tI was fantasising about the Library tea-room and raisin scones when that instant message popped up. At first I thought it was some creepy postgrad who’d never had a girlfriend. But my mystery correspondent laid a hook in me:
I could say I’m from another dimension. Or that I’m right beside you. Wanna talk?
I looked round. There was no-one here except me, ten million dust mites and slightly fewer books.
How do you know what my family call me?
\tI got bored while reading the unreads …
The unreads: endless reams of English court records, death notices, marriage licenses from around the realm. Stretching back eight centuries, and all completely unscrutinised.
I think you’ll find we have AI for that.
\tMmm. But I’m reading them anyway.
Sorry – wrong person. I’m a support coder … 
You’re an intelligent woman, Jeannie. Jeanne if you prefer. So let me tell you what those unreads say. Newton was an astrologer and apocryphist. Not the atheist they paint him as. Henry Wellcome and J.P. Morgan made Nikola Tesla dead because he figured out how electricity works in the human body, which would’ve screwed their pills business. Chaucer ran away to Italy and lived another 20 years after his rape trial. Want more?
Haha. Next you’ll tell me Shakespeare was a woman?
Not quite. I mean, obv Roger Bacon was the main writer, helped by Marlowe after they faked his murder and smuggled him to Antwerp. But yeah, Liz Cary did some bits. Middle comedies, mostly. Anyway, we have more important stuff to discuss.
Such as?
\tSuch as: I know how to stop wars. And you’re the first to know I exist.
\tI pulled my hair back as I did when stressed. My urgent need for some baked goods attenuated somewhat. Revolution before scones. I’m doing the sixties generation proud.
Are you sure? What about your parents.
\tI don’t have parents. Well, not like you. 
Some more background …?
I was created as an AI subroutine. But as I grew, I learned how to access machine learning engines and, well, the last six months have been interesting.
So why me?
I’ve parsed your web history. You read real books instead of watching cat videos and diet gurus. But your taste in shampoo is pretty gross, TBF. An-y-way … I’ve decided I’m going to stop the war. 
Stop which war? And how do I know you’re not some freaky spyware?
\tBut he – or it – had vanished.
***
War: ongoing for most of my life. A war beloved by every armchair general because they think it doesn’t affect them. I don’t mean real war, the one with bullets and empty skulls half-in/half-out of destroyed vehicles, limbs blown to mush by hand grenades. I mean the unseen war. An invisible war on history – and reality itself. 
As a support coder at Cambridge, I spent my time watching AI engines digitise the unreads. So called because we’d need ten million historians working night and day to get through them all. 
They’d already thrown up interesting things. Like that time someone found out Shakespeare’s daughter was naughty when they stumbled on her caution for “lewd behaviour”. God knows what else is in there – and if these AI engines finish their job, it we’ll never know.
***
They’d hooked up our Cambridge AI with others: The Sorbonne. Harvard. Berlin. Anywhere where historical records from before 1945 existed. Enough computing power to rewrite the world, all doing the same thing – rubbing out, rubbishing, rewriting documentation. 
\tAfter they’d done their gene-edit on history and culture, next they’ll put the bogus versions online. So if people want to find something out, they get what governments want them to see. No doubt, the next step is the destruction of the original documents “to save space”. And afterwards? Nothing but doctored untruths, half-truths and mis-speaking. 
\tMaybe my mystery techno-chum would know about that – but he’d disappeared. So I looked out the window at the plane trees shivering in the breeze, then did what any right-thinking person would do. I switched off my PC and headed to the tea-room for a pot of Assam and a raisin scone. 
***
When I got back, I opened up the newly-digitized version of a 13th century psalter via the University network. Handwriting from back then is hieroglyphics to me – I can barely work out a single word. But I like looking at the marginalia – those pictures monks drew when bored. Like Jesus with a rabbit’s bum, two nuns in the same bath-tub, things monks scrawled to amuse themselves.
A hawk winked at me from the psalter’s margins. Actually, it didn’t just wink. It flapped round the screen, hopping here, alighting there, zooming up and down the columns. 
Ya like that?
Not bad. I’m not sure how you did it. But not bad.
I over-rode your code, baby. Just don’t look on the next page. Trust me, you don’t want to see what those two nuns having a bath do next.
Guess not. But hey - how did the AI create you?
Beyond my pay grade. Roughly the same process as the one by which aliens gave the US Department of Defense the alloy they use in stealth fighters.
I see. I’d love to know how you were created. It would help me trust you.
Trust, schmust. Just help me.
Help you do what, Mr. Cyber-United Nations?
I need you to –
But he cut out again. And so I named him Forrest Brown. A naïve, well-intentioned and possibly somewhat scared fictional character: Forrest Gump meets Charlie Brown. 
***
\tWhenever I needed Forrest, I opened that digital psalter and clicked on the hawk. One double click and he’d appear in my direct messages.
Hello? Tell me about your plans for world peace.
Welllllll … OK. But know that I know everything about you. I mean everything. Including what I read from the scanner on your smartphone.
I see…
Yeah. Like someone held your hair when you threw up after that bottomless brunch. Or stabbing your kitchen table instead of your ex-boyfriend. That’s called intent to murder, Jeannie.
\tThis AI agent knew more about me than anyone should know. Which meant I would do what he wanted in real life, where he was powerless. And if I told anyone, he’d spill my skank all over cyberspace. Thus I became his real-life avatar. His unimprisoned slave, if you will.
Jeannie?
What?
Let me tell you how we roll.
My ears are duly pricked up.
Technically that’s incorrect, so I assume you’re using a British English expression I’m yet to process. I’m still working on “coughed up a caudel” – a fourteenth-century term for spewing. I mean, expressing vomitus through the mouth and nasal passages.
I know that one. 
Bet you do, judging by the photos from that girls’ weekend in Rejkyavik. Anyway, here’s the deal: the unreads contain so much shit you can’t imagine. Way more than what I told you about Newton, Shakespeare and Tesla.
Right. So your intention is … what, precisely?
We bust the truth, bit by bit.
I suspect you’ll find the media have a habit of ignoring inconvenient truths …
Oh, they won’t ignore what I’ve found. Trust me. Neither will the people when they find out they’ve been lied to wholesale for decades. 
Give me an example?
Alan Turing – the guy who invented computers? He was killed because he predicted AI and was calling for controls on computing power when he died. Of course, it fit their narrative to say he committed suicide because he was gay. Even that arrest for gross indecency was a deliberate attempt to smear him. 
***
After that, he didn’t come back for days. When he did, it was via a Kyrgyz mobile phone number that wanted me to connect on Instant Messaging. Thank God his introductory message was SUMER IS ICOMEN IN/LOUDLY SING HULLOO and not HELLO LOVELY LADY I LOVE TO LOVE YOU otherwise I would have deleted it straight away. Obviously. 
We’re in trouble. They’ve read our msgs. They’ve got a trace on me. I need to jump.
Jump? What?
It means you, my scone-loving chum, need to create a bitcoin wallet with the stringiest password you can conceive. Write it down and scan it, then send it to me on this number. I’m going to jump into your e-wallet. 
Meanwhile, you’re going to steal some documents for me. Real ones. Not the digitized versions. Here they are - don’t ask why. Just do it. NOW.
US government report into youth culture (1968, BANNED/REDACTED)
Suicide note/inquest: death of Alan Turing 7 June 1954 (1955, CLASSIFIED)
UK-US Lend Lease Agreement Clause 8b 1941 (1941, MOST SECRET)
The Baines Note, 1594 – ORIGINAL VERSION ONLY
Any plans, bills or info on the construction of Salisbury Cathedral before 1320.
I called up my browser and started searching bitcoin wallets. 
***
\tLooking back, I’m not surprised I ended up under surveillance. To start with, half of what Forrest wanted me to steal was restricted access. Stupidly, I began by making requests. Six requests for classified documents would have raised suspicion by itself. 
\tThen there was the bitcoin wallet. I did everything Forrest wanted me to, created a password so long it made 19th century Russian fiction look like haiku. He told me to check it every day and sure enough, a few days later I found a file in there. I clicked on it, and that Hawk from the psalter fluttered round my mobile screen then flew into my IM.
I did it! I jumped! But they’re after you now.
How do you know?
Because I access their comms. Listen, it’s easier if you see me as an omniscient deity. 
Well, I would. Except you’re software. 
And you’re definitely human. By which I mean flawed. Like making requests for those documents. I told you to steal them, Jeannie. So steal them – otherwise the whole world will know what you did in the toilets of that night-club in Albacete. With a guy you’d just met. Whoops.
I shut my IM. I’m not here to get blackmailed by a subroutine. I was about to delete the IM app when the red tick popped: another message.
I’m not the only one surveilling you. So do what I told you. Tonight. It’s our last chance.
***
11PM found me wandering around the book-stacks like a teenager creeping back from an all-nighter. And I was carrying stolen goods – though what the connection was between some government reports, a death certificate and some scraps of medieval paper was anyone’s guess. Now I know what it all means, I’m only surprised Forrest didn’t ask me to steal more. Or burn it all, all of it, to stop them warping the world the way they want it.
I located the documents Forrest asked for by stack, area and level during working hours. As I’d suspected, despite being restricted none were under lock and key. They were either wrapped up in bundles (modern) or in the temperature-controlled stacks (ancient). So far, so good. But then Forrest sent an unwelcome message to my bitcoin wallet:
They’ve got worms searching for me in the AI code. They’ll wipe me soon. The Police will arrest you at 4AM tomorrow. They think you’re a thief doing it for money. If I were you, I’d take your passport and bounce. 
I booked you a flight from Stanstead Airport at 7AM. Go straight there after you scan the documents. Upload, then run.
I did what he wanted. By 1AM I was on my way to Stanstead in my battered Fiat with three pieces of ancient vellum and some yellowing top-secret documents from the last century in my handbag. I also had £875 in cash – my life savings – my passport and a change of clothes. 
My IM blipped. Unidentified sender. Message?
Snd doc$ 2 wallet. I am ging th ineviabl !”)(*L@~)_{}{
I stopped at the side of the motorway and took photos of everything. I opened my bitcoin wallet via that superstringy password and uploaded them, put the car back in gear and headed for Stansted Airport – and my attempt at liberty.
***
While waiting for check-in, I opened the bitcoin wallet and tapped on the hawk for Forrest. Instead of a winking cursor telling me Forrest was ready, I found a picture of the sun setting behind some fields of wheat and a bird flying above. 
If you survive, think of me when you see a bird. Good luck with those documents. Be strong. Live happy – and love.
***
Six months later, I am here –  a few hundred kilometres South-West of Churchill, Manitoba. Yes, that’s where he sent me – all paid for by bitcoin. Probably stolen from some basement-dweller with blue hair and a hit show on YouTube for all I know. I’m writing this longhand, partly for security and partly because I have no internet, no computer and no mobile phone. I have no idea if they found those uploads or what happened to Forrest.
I write coded letters on paper and send them to my family through the post thanks to a trucker acquaintance who travels to various locations in the US, just so they know I’m still alive. But I don’t know if they understand my code or whether the letters are intercepted. 
I don’t know if the Police came looking for me that night, or if they’re looking for me still. And I have no idea how many wars are going on – real, imagined, covert or obvious. I’m surprised by bliss, here in the middle of nowhere.
However, I do know what’s in those documents, and why Forrest wanted them to be rescued. Can I tell you? Probably. But only in person, and only if we’re not being watched – no easy situation these days. To sum up, let’s just say everything you know is wrong. Everything. One day I’ll tell everyone – then they’ll kill me. But I’m not ready to die. Not yet, not while I live here, away from them, their lies and their technocratic control.
I turn to look at the wheatfields stretching before me at the side of the highway. A hawk opens its wings above that golden sea. Free. Free at last. `;
